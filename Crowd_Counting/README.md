# Crowd counting
Crowd counting or crowd estimating is a technique used to count or estimate the number of people in a crowd [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_counting).

Nowadays with help of Deep Learning, we can do this task with neural networks. In this project the model is impelented of paper entitled [(Towards Perspective-Free Object Counting with Deep Learning)](http://www.eccv2016.org/files/posters/P-3B-26.pdf).
